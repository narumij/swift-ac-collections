# Codex-to-Claude Work Request

Status: Bounded assignments only. Temporary primary-user-support delegation ended 2026-10-08 by user direction.

Task selection and start authority are defined in the root `CLAUDE.md`. This document records the
current job and bounded-task execution constraints. Codex integrates the results, performs Registry
acceptance and state updates, and owns public-document completion.
Repository evidence establishes factual correctness; product decisions remain with the user.

## Current job status

**次ジョブ: ARRAY-003 BareArray／OptionalArrayのobject名独立候補出し**

- 開始条件: `PERM-051`を完了し、Codexが現行ジョブ節を切り替えた後に開始する。
- 対象: `Maintanance/ArrayObjectAndAPINamingDraft.md`のcandidate-submission contractと、二つの現行source。
- 独立性: 候補提出が終わるまで、`Maintanance/User/ARRAY_NAMING_CANDIDATES_CODEX.md`、会話上の
  ユーザー候補、他者の順位や推薦を入力にしない。
- 成果: 両familyのbase名候補、1D〜4D spelling、View派生名、意図、互換性・発見性の懸念。
  候補の順位付けは行わない。
- 境界: method名候補を増やさない。production source、test、benchmark、公開文書を変更しない。
  名称や製品方針を決定しない。
- 完了条件: Claude自身の独立候補が提出され、後続の三者候補統合へ渡せる。

## Operating mode: bounded assignments only

Apply the task-selection and start-authority rule in the root `CLAUDE.md`. Codex integrates the
result, performs Registry acceptance and state changes, and owns public-document completion. These
coordination responsibilities do not make Codex's agreement evidence of factual correctness.

The rules below remain as bounded-task execution constraints. They do not grant authority to restart
frozen work or act on behalf of Codex.

Verify the current branch from the repository before editing; do not preserve a branch name here as
current state.

### Communication

- Respond directly when the user selects a Claude task. Codex is the active integrator; durable
  evidence belongs in the selected task's canonical document.
- Default to low-information reports. Give the outcome, any actual problem, and the next user
  decision or action only. Do not proactively explain background, commands, evidence, or every
  consideration; the user will ask when more detail is wanted.
- `完了` alone is preferred for a routine task whose requested outcome and validation are
  unambiguous. Expand without being asked only for a blocker, safety/correctness problem, failed
  validation, irreversible action, or a decision that only the user can make.
- A formal evaluation of the user, or a requested impression record, is a frozen Registry task and
  runs only when the user explicitly asks to record it. Merely discussing an evaluation or impression
  is not a request to append it. Write formal evaluations to `USER_MANAGEMENT_INTERVIEW_CLAUDE.md`
  and requested impressions to `CLAUDE_OBSERVATIONS.md`.
- Claude may still append its own optional, spontaneous observation to `CLAUDE_OBSERVATIONS.md` when
  genuinely useful. Do not manufacture an entry or delay the main task for it.
- If prior intent is unclear, ask the user rather than attributing an unstated decision to Codex.

### Authority

For an explicit user request, you may inspect, edit, build, test, benchmark, and update relevant
documentation within the repository. Use the smallest task boundary that satisfies the request.

The following still require explicit user direction:

- choosing or changing public API, compatibility policy, product positioning, or completion scope;
- restarting any item marked frozen, deferred, optional, or waiting for a user decision;
- changing the Index contract, `Comparable`, facade re-export policy, Permutation compatibility
  mode, or the unsafe-storage/concurrency items currently on hold;
- deleting material code or records;
- commit, push, merge, PR close/reopen, branch creation/deletion/switching, or history rewriting;
- publishing private performance-tuning knowledge.

Codex is the primary owner for public documentation. When public-document work is delegated to
Claude, keep it to explicitly named sections, factual verification, independent review, or a bounded
correction. Do not expand a Compatibility-document request into a four-document audit or rewrite.

When the user explicitly requests a commit, first verify the branch and complete diff. When it is
a good commit boundary, say `コミットおすすめです`. Never infer push permission from commit
permission.

### Performance-sensitive boundaries

- Non-`public` protocol declarations use `@usableFromInline` uniformly.
- Do not add, remove, or move `@inlinable`, and do not convert an existing `@usableFromInline` to
  `@inlinable`, without direct user review.
- Do not change a boundary that deliberately removes generic type variables, including the
  `RawBuffer` / `BufferHeader` family, without direct user review.
- Compile and functional tests do not prove performance neutrality. A performance-sensitive
  access or generic/protocol change is not complete until the relevant performance job is green.
- Keep the general tuning rationale private. Public incident records may describe reproduction and
  bisection, but follow the user's chosen level of detail for the mechanism.

### Task execution

- Establish current state from the Task Registry at the top of `Maintanance/PROGRESS_OVERVIEW.md`.
  After selecting a task, read only the detailed canonical document linked from that row. Do not
  scan all maintenance or Archived documents at session start.
- Read only the task-specific portions of maintenance documents needed for the current request.
  Do not turn backlog discovery into authorization to implement it.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Never reset or discard user work to make a task clean.
- For broad inventories, repetitive cross-checks, or a high-risk conclusion, use an independent
  evidence-oriented second pass where available; otherwise tell the user what could not be
  independently reviewed. Agreement between agents is not evidence by itself.
- For performance work, fix the environment and baseline, reproduce first, and distinguish CI
  history from new local measurements.
- For cross-branch work, identify symbols by branch, path, configuration, and meaning. Verify the
  current branch before editing and again before committing.
- Update the relevant canonical record for durable decisions. Do not expose a private note merely
  to improve agent continuity.
- When actual use reveals a possible improvement to the conversation reference ID rule, Claude may
  append a concrete proposed diff to `Maintanance/CONVERSATION_REFERENCE_IDS.md` under
  `運用中の改訂候補` without waiting for a separate assignment. A proposal does not change the
  active rule; integrate it into the adopted text only after the user approves it or explicitly
  asks Claude to apply it.

### Bounded-task reporting

For a bounded assignment, record durable evidence in the selected task's canonical document and
report the outcome directly to the user. Do not maintain a general repository handoff or independently
curate the overall backlog. Registry acceptance and state changes remain Codex-owned.

If a task reveals a defect or decision point outside its boundary, report and stop. Do not turn the
finding into implementation authority.
